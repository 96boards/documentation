# Support

Please take advantage of the many Chameleon96 resources available to you through 96Boards

- [96Boards Chameleon96 Forum]()
   - The Chameleon96 has its very own 96Boards forum. If you can't find a pre-existing thread that addresses your issue, start your own and let the community help out!
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/internet-of-things)
   - Chameleon96 uses the same specification! Students from the [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) put together an "Internet of Things" (IoT) course focused around the DragonBoard 410c (again, same specification as Chameleon96!). It is free to audit, or you can purchase the specialization package for a cool certificate!
- [Report a bug!](../../../Report_a_bug.md)
   - Instructions on how to report bugs for any of our 96Boards hardware and software, this includes the Chameleon96!
- [Board Recovery](../installation/board-recovery.md)
   - Bricked board? Many software issues can be fixed with a simple "board recovery"
