### Fastboot Method

Fastboot is supported by the board and can be used for installs. This is for advanced users who are most likely modifying/customizing source code and will need to download such updates to the board for test/execution.

This method requires the following hardware:

- Host machine (Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows)
- USB to USB Type C cable
- USB Mouse and/or keyboard (not required to perform flash)
- HDMI Monitor with full size HDMI cable (not required to perform flash)

Go to the [Downloads page](../downloads/) to get your bootloader, boot image, and root file system image (rootfs).
