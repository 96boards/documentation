# 1) Introduction
## 1.1) About the 96Boards D3 Camera Mezzanine

The [96Boards D3 Camera Mezzanine](https://www.96boards.org/product/d3camera/) is paired with a 5MP micro camera module (OV5640) to
enable rapid development of embedded vision applications.
Direct MIPI CSI-2 access to camera data allows more realistic evaluation of embedded vision designs.
Direct access eliminates the need to decode USB or Ethernet protocols, resulting in lower power and
higher performance.
The kit includes demonstration software running Linux to display 1080p video via HDMI. It is ideal for
algorithm development, end application development, and evaluation of image sensors and optics.
