# Debian

**Debian Linux** is a desktop/window or console (command line) based development environment comprised of some basic programs and utilities. Development can happen directly on the board, and within the OS. While applications and programs can be built directly on the board, they can also be built remotely and cross-compiled for the particular system.

## Debian 9 (*"stretch"*) installer with custom kernel

Developerbox has been comprehensively supported by the Linux kernel since
`v4.16` (and `v4.15` has support for everything except the on-board network
card). Since currently very few distributions for AArch64 are shipped with
suitable kernels, Linaro has temporarily provided a custom installer.
We plan to discontinue this images as soon as Developerbox support is added
by the upstream distribution.
