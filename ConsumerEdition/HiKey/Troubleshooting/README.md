# Troubleshooting

Please take advantage of the many HiKey resources available to you through 96Boards, SeeedStudio, and Coursera

- [96Boards HiKey Forum](http://www.96boards.org/forums/forum/products/hikey/)
   - The DragonBoard has its very own 96Boards forum. If you can't find a pre-existing thread that addresses your issue, start your own and let the community help out!
- [LeMaker Forum](http://forum.lemaker.org/)
   - Similar to the 96Boards forum; however, this page will have threads for all LeMaker products
- [LeMaker Wiki](http://wiki.lemaker.org/HiKey(LeMaker_version))
   - This page offers some extra HiKey resources
- [SeeedStudio](http://www.seeedstudio.com/)
   - Buy the HiKey here!
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/internet-of-things)
   - HiKey uses the same specification! Students from the [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) put together an "Internet of Things" (IoT) course focused around the DragonBoard 410c(again, same specification as HiKey!). It is free to audit, or you can purchase the specialization package for a cool certificate!
- [Report a bug!](../../../Extras/Report_a_bug.md)
   - Instructions on how to report bugs for any of our 96Boards hardware and software, this includes the HiKey!
- [Board Recovery](../Installation/BoardRecovery.md)
   - Bricked board? Many software issues can be fixed with a simple "board recovery"
